\abstract{
The main focus of the thesis is on the development of an ungrounded haptic device called MotionPerformer, which is designed to show the self-motion of a vehicle in virtual space. The device uses a combination of sensors and actuators to provide users with the haptic feeling of motion, which can be used to improve the automation operating system in virtual space. The thesis includes a detailed description of the design and implementation of the MotionPerformer device, as well as an evaluation of its effectiveness in providing the haptic feeling of motion. Overall, the thesis provides valuable insights into the use of haptic devices for self-motion perception in virtual reality, and demonstrates the potential of MotionPerformer for improving the user experience in virtual environments.

\kmdacknowledgements{
Firstly, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Professor Kouta MINAMIZAWA, as well as the dedicated team at the Embodied Media Laboratory under his supervision, for their comprehensive support during the course of this research.

I am particularly indebted to Project Assistant Professor Arata HORIE for his expert advice and invaluable guidance in the specialized area of haptics that formed the cornerstone of my research.

Additionally, I am grateful for Project Senior Assistant Professor Yun Suen PAI, whose consistent feedback and insightful direction during the preliminary stages of the design process were instrumental. I also wish to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Project Associate Professor Tatsuya SAITO, who provided crucial support within the context of device application scenarios.

Special mention must be made of Professor Akira KATO for his thoughtful guidance and clarifications, which greatly aided in shaping the overarching direction and methodology of the paper.

Lastly, I am thankful to my peers in the research laboratory, Doctoral Student Ximing Shen, for her instructive input regarding the structuring and data analysis of the manuscript, and Doctoral Student Yulan Ju, whose repeated assistance and contributions to the design process were deeply appreciated.
